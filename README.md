## What Does it do? How does it work?
OneList is a productivity app that helps you accomplish a certain task or be more productive. With useState and React, functions and handlers are implemented to create and delete notes or to-dos. Boolean values are used to filter todos based on if they are completed or not. localStorage is used to save and retrieve the array of to-dos. react-beautiful-dnd is used to create draggable and droppable reordering todos that alter or swap positions with another to-do. These to-dos are updated with each mutated event.
